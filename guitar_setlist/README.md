# setlist_automation

with this automation, i just paste the songs list into a txt file, and in a few seconds i have the youtube backing track playlist with all songs. (execution details along the code)

the story behind:
    I solved a day-to-day task that was very tedious for me.
	Whenever my band has a show, I practice the songs at home, with "backing tracks" (which is the original song but without the guitar) so that I can play the guitar together and the song become complete.
However, getting one by one and saving into a playlist was a waste of time.
    Because of that, I made this code and while it runs I can relax and tune the guitar.
